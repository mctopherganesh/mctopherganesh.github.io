This is the repo for my website, [mctopherganesh.com](https://mctopherganesh.com).

I use Github Pages to host, iwantmyname for the URL, and Cloudfare for all the other internet things I don't understand.

If you find a bug, submit an issue. That would be super cool.

If you like it and need a site, I would be honored if you stole it.

Let me know what you think!
