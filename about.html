		<p>Hello there and welcome to my website. My name is Chris and you are invited to click around on all the stuff but if you do break anything please let me know (remind to put pull issue url here, or something).</p>


		<p>I started learning how to code about 4 years ago (winter of 2014). I first started because I thought that there had to be a better way to search the internet than Google but then in the process of teaching myself to code, I found that there really isn't.</p>
		
		<p>The one thing I've learned about how to code is this: You have to be comfortable breaking something anyone can make, ask dumb questions about it, then make it yourself but in your own way.</p>

		<p>I am a freelancer at the moment. Right now freelancing as a QA Analyst for an online content(think videos) creation company. I test things (read: break perfectly working things our devs make). I do some research for them too.</p>

		<p><!--Outside of putting my blind faith on that the next programming tutorial I do will make me (feel like) a programmer or breaking things things I don't intend to fix and getting paid for it</p>-->Outside of programming and the freelancing I like to do other things to. I like writing, working really hard on a tweet, learning, automating things I do because I hate moving my hands from my keyboard, daydreaming about being on an agile data science/engineering squadron, bicycling fast for fitness, running (not sure why), making and drinking coffee, food (all but seriously will do automation projects for pizza).
