It's complicated because it's totally the project I want to do but it's working in a way and with people that I wouldn't really choose. Just the idea of the project alone, not even the project itself was taking up a lot of space in my mind <!--so I quit it because I want more time to code and sometimes it's right to quit things that take up space in your head. it's a really good project too, but it just doesn't feel like the right one. I wish we were doing it a different way but this freelancer stuff isn't that great sometimes. You don't really get a say in what you're doing or how you're doing it. I don't know how to farm clout as a freelancer. Honestly I just want to keep working on my coding. I have this feeling like I'm about to hit it big, like get a really good position or job or something, a place where I will really fit in and I can leave this freelancer stuff behind me.-->. \n",

I'm sure the other side of that is that's bad testing if you don't know what you're working on is not working right? \n",
