I don't intend negative attitude or connotations when I say fail and fail fast. Fail as fast as you can. The reason I've ever learned how to build a program that worked is because of errors. I would have never looked up the next thing on Google. These days where you think you've spent hours reading documentation and minutes coding are great days! You have done good work these days. But do not put your faith into one resource. You must be _doing_ it. No one can teach you. Coding is like painting. You can hang with B Ross and watch him paint things. Or you can do it with him (I really hope most people paint with him). \n",
