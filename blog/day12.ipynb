    "As I started writing this post I realized how many days I have start writing blog posts that sound like this one. What I was writing about before I deleted all of it was how I started working on something, got stuck, and hunted down the solution. As an hour went by (I have spent far longer on easier solutions) I realized I was digging myself a hole and just stopped because writing this blog post was more important to me than staying up late to figure out something that I already kind of have a solution to. Here's some context:\n",

    "Today I didn't have many ideas about what to work on. I wanted to Dataquest it up (a site that has you do data science training by challenges and what not, a resource I've used in the past <!--and took out a microloan to pay for this time but since doing that, I have barely touched it. Actually...barely is an overstatement...--> and I have really liked it. I also do (want to) believe that in my learning, I have to have one learning path to come back to because I am a resource hog <- by that I mean I will spend more time hording resources than I will coding. \n",

    "I opened up one of the missions and saw that it was doing a walkthrough of some data analysis. I wanted to copy it into my own notebook at the same time I was doing it. Above this blob of text is a cell that says `import numpy`. That's as far as I got.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few weeks ago, I could import just about any data science library included in the Anaconda distribution and it would work. No problems at all. A week or two ago I ran `conda update conda` for some reason (which I never do), thinking that I haven't updated conda in awhile (or maybe I saw something, or read something. I honestly don't know) and every since then I cannot import anything that I've easily used before. Watch."

    "All stuff I have used before. There was a post I did a few days ago where I was using BeautifulSoup (another library included in the Anaconda distribution) and I had to reinstall it which I found weird. Selenium as well which I use constantly. \n",

Working on things that are well outside of my realm of knowledge, **every day** I am going to have probably hundreds of days like this. Days that devolve into solving the smallest issues that there are probably hundreds of work arounds for. For example, I could/should have just kept working on Dataquest and then (I'm pretty sure) I could download the notebook afterwards. Also, IBM has a platform where you can use Jupyter Notebooks and everything you need is preinstalled. Microsoft too. Also Mode. There are a bunch of open source platforms now. \n",

I started coding late tonight and that's why I eventually quit trying to find a solution (which I didn't need) and didn't pivot to using an environment that would just work right off the bat. Also, if I had started earlier, I may have dove straight into fixing the issue as well.\n",
